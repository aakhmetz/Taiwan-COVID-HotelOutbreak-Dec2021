# Clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine hotels in Taiwan with presumptive environmental mode of transmission

*work in progress*

In mid-December 2021, two clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in quarantine hotels in Taiwan, both in cities in the Northeast. In light of a recent study addressing probable transmission of the Omicron variant between two travelers at a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong as well as the increasing transmissability of new variants, these incidents of quarantine hotel transmission in Taiwan merit further study.   

In one instance, a cluster of 7 cases of the Delta varient was identified in a quarantine hotel in Taoyuan. The cluster was identified after the Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) undertook investigation of a Taiwanese man who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 seven days after leaving quarantine. Though the man's test results indicated fairly recent infection, all of his contacts in Taiwan tested negative. All hotel workers also tested negative, but 6 other travelers with overlapping stays at the same quarantine hotel tested positive. Of the 7 total cases, 6 stayed in neighboring rooms on the same floor of the hotel, while one stayed 2 floors above.No evidence of direct contact between cases was identified by the CECC, though all cases had mattched S gene sequencing, and all individuals had received at least one dose of a vaccine. A subsequent epidemiological investigation suggests environmental transmission as a source of infection, though the exact mode is unclear. Proposed potential sources include food collection or issues with the ventilation system, which may be more likely as one individual was infected from 2 stories up.

An unrelated cluster of infections was identified shortly after in a quarantine hotel in Taipei. In this instance, a Taiwanese woman who recently returned from Cambodia was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 two days after release from quarantine. An epidemiological investigation into the quarantine hotel at which she stayed confirmed another positive case: the man staying in the adjacent room who had recently returned from the U.S. Genetic sequencing revealed that the two individuals were infected with the same strain of Delta, which was different from the strain in the Taoyuan cluster and other local cases. CECC exploration further revealed that there were no reports of the same strain of Delta in Cambodia, while there were 1,600 identical cases reported in with the same strain in the US. These findings suggest that tranmission between these two individuals within the quarantine hotel is probable, and likely through environmental transmission, though the exact mode is also unclear. 

In response to these recent clusters, the CECC introduced four strengthened measures for quarantine hotels to prevent further quarantine hotel cluster infections. These measures include: (1) enhancing monitoring efforts and increasing the number of tests required, the number of inspections, and penalties for violations during the Lunar New Year Quarantine Programs, (2) Conducting inspections of epidemic prevention and control measures in quarantine hotels, (3) conducting inspections of ventilation and air conditioning systems in quarantine hotels, and (4) enhancing reporting of symptomatic individuals.
