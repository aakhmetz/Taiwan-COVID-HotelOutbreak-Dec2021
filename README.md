# Clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections in quarantine hotels in Taiwan with presumptive environmental mode of transmission

*work in progress*

In mid-December 2021, two clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in quarantine hotels in Taiwan, both in cities in the Northeast. In light of a recent study addressing probable transmission of the Omicron variant between two travelers at a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong as well as the increasing transmissability of new variants, these incidents in Taiwan merit further study.   

In one instance, a cluster 7 cases of the Delta varient was identified in a quarantine hotel in Taoyuan. 6 individuals were found to have stayed on the same floor of the hotel along the same corridor, while 1 individual stayed 2 floors above. All hotel workers tested negative for the virus. No evidence of direct contact between cases was identified by the CECC, though all cases had mattched S gene sequencing, and all individuals had received at least one dose of a vaccine. A subsequent epidemiological investigation suggests environmental transmission as a source of infection, though the exact mode is unclear. Proposed potential sources include food collection or issues with the ventilation system.

An unrelated cluster of  infections was identified shortly after in a quarantine hotel in Taipei. In this instance, a Taiwanese woman who recently returned from Cambodia was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 two days after release from quarantine. An epidemiological investigation into the quarantine hotel she had stayed at confirmed another positive case: the man staying in the adjacent room who had recently returned from the U.S. Genetic sequencing revealed that the two individuals were infected with the same strain of Delta, which was different from the strain in the Taoyuan cluster and other local cases. CECC exploration further revealed that there were no reports of the same strain of Delta in Cambodia, though it has been widely identified in the U.S. These findings suggest that tranmission between these two individuals within the quarantine hotel is probable, and likely through environmental transmission, though the exact mode is also unclear.
